# Snake-Adventure
A Python/Pygame Snake game

<i> Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,School of Sciences,Department of Informatics</i>
<br>Project for the cource <b><i>Learning Theories and Educational Software- Python Programming</b></i> for the Academic Year 2015-2016



In this project, we had to implement our own Videogame in python language and with the use of the PyGame Library. I developed a basic snake game called Snake Adventure. In the game, the player controls the snake, eats apples and progresses through the levels while avoiding the obstacles. I used many of the features that Pygame contained such as Images/Sounds and Movie before it was removed.

 <br><br> The project was succesfully evaluated in October 2016 with score <b>3 /3</b>
